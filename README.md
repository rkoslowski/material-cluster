# Materials Visualization Scripts

This repository contains a collection of small scripts designed to visualize material properties in relation to **structural dynamics**. The dataset includes approximately **5,000 materials**, and the scripts generate both **2D and 3D plots**. Visualization and clustering are performed using the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm**, providing insights into how these materials behave based on their relevant properties.
